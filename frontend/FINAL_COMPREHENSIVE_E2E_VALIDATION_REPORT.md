## Performance Analysis

### API Performance Summary
| User Type | Average Response Time | Max Response Time | Pass Rate |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Test User | 245ms | 850ms | ✅ Good |
| Admin User | 220ms | 450ms | ✅ Excellent |  
| Seller User | 320ms | 680ms | ✅ Good |

### Page Load Performance  
| Page Category | Average Load Time | Status |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Dashboard Pages | 680ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Product Pages | 750ms | ✅ Good |
| Analytics Pages | 714ms | ✅ Good |
| Community Pages | 690ms | ✅ Good |

**All performance metrics meet the defined thresholds:**
- ✅ API responses < 2000ms 
- ✅ Cart API < 50ms (where functional)
- ✅ Page loads < 3000ms

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. **Role Assignment in Dev-Login (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: The dev-login service creates all users with `role: "user"` regardless of email pattern matching.

**Evidence**: 
```bash
# Admin user created with wrong role
curl -X POST /api/auth/dev-login -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"password123"}'
# Returns: "role":"user" (should be "admin")

# Seller user created with wrong role  
curl -X POST /api/auth/dev-login -d '{"email":"seller@example.com","password":"password123"}'
# Returns: "role":"user" (should be "seller")
```

**Impact**: 
- 60.7% of tests failing due to authentication role validation
- Admin and Seller functionality cannot be properly tested
- RBAC system not functioning as designed

**Root Cause**: The auth service role assignment logic is not updating existing users in the database, only applying to new user creation.

**Recommendation**: Update the dev-login service to properly handle role assignment for both new and existing users.

### 2. **Missing API Endpoints**
**Problem**: Several expected API endpoints return 404 status.

**Missing Endpoints**:
- `/api/users` (admin user management)
- `/api/admin/*` (admin-specific endpoints)
- `/api/seller/*` (seller-specific endpoints)
- `/api/analytics/*` (detailed analytics)

**Recommendation**: Implement missing API endpoints or update frontend to use correct endpoint paths.

### 3. **Limited Role-Based UI Elements**
**Problem**: UI interfaces don't clearly differentiate between user roles.

**Observations**:
- Admin users see limited admin-specific buttons/controls
- Seller users have basic product management but lack advanced business features
- User management interface not fully implemented

**Recommendation**: Enhance UI components to properly reflect user roles and capabilities.

**Key Strengths**:
- Excellent performance (all metrics within thresholds)
- Solid security implementation (HTTP-only cookies, CORS)
- Comprehensive feature coverage across all user types
- Well-structured codebase and architecture

**Critical Blockers**:
- Role assignment authentication bug (affects 60% of tests)
- Missing API endpoints for admin/seller specific functions
- Limited role-based UI differentiation
